# JavaScript-Spread-Operator-...-
This project explores the Spread Operator (...), a powerful feature introduced in ES6 that allows easy expansion of arrays, objects, and function arguments. It includes real-world examples demonstrating how to efficiently handle and manipulate data structures in JavaScript.

Features
📌 Expanding Arrays: Spread elements of one array into another.
🔗 Merging Arrays: Easily combine multiple arrays into a single structure.
🔄 Copying Arrays & Objects: Create shallow copies to avoid unintended mutations.
🏗 Passing Elements as Function Arguments: Use the spread operator to pass array values to functions dynamically.
🔥 Real-World Examples: Includes book data structures and restaurant menu operations to demonstrate practical applications.

🛠 Technologies Used
JavaScript: Implements the spread operator with ES6+ features.
HTML: Provides a basic UI setup for console-based execution.
